### cash
* anything a bank will accept for deposit: checks, money orders, travelers' chekcs, bank credit card splits, (cash equivalents)
* bank reconciliation
  * to arrive at proper amount for balance sheet
  * to prevent/detect embezzlement
  * should not be done by person who issues checks and handles cash
  * company's books ($X + bank collections + interest - NSF checks deposited - bank service charges - EFT payments +/- errors = $Z)
  * bank statement ($Y + depositis in transit + cash on hand - outstanding checks +/- erros = $Z)
### receivables
* accounts receivable (A/R): what to do about bed debts?
* do not reduce net sales, instead, record a bad debts expense
* for income statement, matching principle for bad debt expense
* allowance methods: estimate losses
  * for balance sheet: A/R (net)= A/R - allowrance for abd debts
* esimation methods
  * 1. percentage of credit sales method
    bad debt expense = percentage of credit sales (this amount is added to allowance for bad debts)
    example: bad debt expense = 2% of $500,000 credit sales = $10,000
  * 2. percentage of receivables method
    new allowance for bad debts = percentage of ending balance in A/R
    bad bebt expense = new allowance for bad bebts - previous allowance for bad debts
    example: previous allow. for B.D. = $1800
    ending ablance of A/R=$100,000:
        <30days: $62,000 * 1% = %620
        31-60days: $15000*3%=$450
        61-120days: $20000*7%=1400
        >120days: $3000*20%=$600
     new allow.for B.D = $620 + $450 + 1400+600=3070
     bad debt expense = 3070-1800=1270
 * notes receivalbe (N/R)
  * formal contracts signed when a customer buys merchandise or services on credit
  * clasifieed as a current or long-term asset, depending on due date
* terminology
  * principle - the face amout of the note
  * interest rate - a percentage of the principla the maker is charged ato borrow money
  * maturity value - principal plus interest
  * principal * interest rage * time = interest 
  * example: on January 1, a company sold equipment and received a 90 day, 5000 note. the interst rate is 14%
    interst = 5000*0.14*90/365 = 172.60
### inventory & cost of goods sold
* inventory
 * good either manufactured or purchased for resale (raw material, finished goods, work in process)
 * ownership (goods in transit, goods on consignment)
* cost of goods sold: beginning invetory + net purchases - ending inventory = cost of goods sold
* net purchases: purchases + freight-in - purchase returns & allowances - purcahses discounts = net purchases
* sales - costs of goods sold = gross margin
* gross method vs. net method
  example: sale of item that cost 150 for 250
  gross method: 250-150=100 (sales revenue - CGS = gross margin )
  net method: 100-0=100(sales revenue - CGS = gross margin )
* perpetual inventory system
 * records updated when purchase or sale is made
 * most often used when each item has a relatively high value
* periodic inventory system
 * records are not updated when a purchase or a sale is made
 * used when inventory is coposed of a largenumber of divese items, each with a relatively low value
### inventory cost flows
* inventory cost flow (specific identification, first in first out, last in first out, weighted average)
* example: kernel king buys and sells corn and had the following transtion in june
 june 5 - purchased 10 tons at 6 per ton
 june 18 - purcahsed 10 tons at 9 per ton
 june 27 - sold 10 tons at 11 per ton
 how much did kernal king make in june?
 case#1 - sold old corn 110 - 60 = 50
 case#2 - sold new corn 110 - 90 = 20
 case#3 - sold mixed corn 110 - 75 = 35
* LIFO gives better reflection of CGS -> LIFO is a better meausre of income
* FIFO gives a better meausre of ending inventory -> FIFO is a better meausre for the balance sheet
* LIFO conformity rule
 * lower of cost or market: inventory is reported at less than cost when:
   * the future value of the inventory is in doubt (damaged, used, obsolete)
   * it can be replaced new at a price less than the original cost
### prepaid expnese & investment
* prepaid expense (prepaid rent, prepaid insuance)
  transferred to expenses over time (when benefits are received)
* marketable securities, short term investment in stock or bonds
 * stocks reported at market
 * bonds reported at cost 
* long-term investments
 * ownership of >50% of company's stock -> consolidated fiancials statement
 * ownership of 20%-50% of company's stock -> equity method
 * ownership of < 20% of company' stock -> same as short term investment
 
 ```
Cash + Net accounts receivable + Inventories = Total current assets
Notes payable + Accounts payable + Accrued expenses + Current portion of L. T. debt = Total current liabilities
Total current liabilities + Long-term (L.T.) debt* = Total liabilities
