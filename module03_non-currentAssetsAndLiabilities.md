### Property, plant and equipment
* fixed (tangible) assets: lands, buildings, equipment, land, imporvments, naural resources (depltetion)
* intangible assets (amortization)
* depreciation, depltetion, amortization: the process of cost allocation that assigns the cost of the asset to the periods benefited
* purchased assets: include all costs incurred to get the asset ready for use: freight, installiton, testing
* self-constructed asets: cost includes all expenditures incurred to build the asset and make it ready for its intended use (materials used to build the asset, construction labor, share of the general company overhead, capitalizaed interest)
  * expenditures on existing assets: 
    * ordinary expenditures, typically benefit only the period in which they are made (repairs, maintenance, and minor improvments)
    * capitalized expenditures, benefit the compnay over several peridos, not just the current one, capitalized on balance sheet (criteria: increase productive life or capacity of the asset)

### depreciation
* determining depreciation: estimate of useful life(intended life), estimate of salvge (residual, scrap)
* methods of depreciation
 * straight-line, the cost of the asset is allocated equally over the periods of an asset's estimated useful life
   annaul amount = (cost - salvage value) / useful life
 * units of output
 * accelerated depreciation (sum of years digits, double declining balance)
* balance sheet presentation: equipment - accumulated depreciation(contra-asset) = equipment (net) (book value)
* disposal of assets 
 * proceeds > book value -> gain on sale
 * proceeds < book value -> loss on sale
* natural resources: depletion expense - similar to units of output method of depreciation 
### intangible assets
* definite life - amortization over min (economic life, legal life)
* indefinite life - impairment
* goodwill: purchases price of business - fair market value of net assets (if > 0) 
* software development costs -- special form of R&D which may be capitalized (economic viability can be determined more accurately and earlier than other R&D)
* capitalization begins when technological feasibility is reached. software costs incurred up to this point are expensed as R&D
* technological feasibility - sufficient development progress has been made to ascertain that the software will meet its design specifications (it will work)
* capitalization ends and amortization begins when the product is availably for general release
### liabilities
* current liabilities: debts and other obligations due within one year
 * examples of current liabilities: account payable, wages payable, income taxes payable, unearned revenues, estimated warranty liabilties. 
* contingent liabilities: disclosure in notes
* long term liabilities: debts obligations not due within one year (transferred to current liability status the year before due date)
 * examples: notes payable, mortgages payable, lease obligations, deferred taxes, bonds payable, pension obligations
* recording long term liabilities: meausrement and recording of long term liabilities are based on the time value of money concept
* present value of liability: future amounts are discounted to obtain present value
* lease obligations:
 * operating lease: a simple short term rental agreenment
 * capital lease: asset and liability are recorded at present value of future payments. Criteria: non-cancelable & one of the following conditions:
  * transfer of ownership at end of lease term
  * option to purchase sset at bargain price
  * lease term > 75% life of asset
  * PV of lease payments > 90% of asset's fair market value
 * deferred taxes: results from the dfiferent between taxable income on income statement and taxable income for IRS
### bonds
* bonds payable: debt instruments sold to public & publicly traded (company must repay principle pluts interest)
* face value = amount to pay when bond matures (not necessarily the initial selling price of bond)
* bond discounts and preminums: 
 * stated interest rate < market interest rate -> discount
 * stated interst rate > market interest rate -> premium
* balance sheet presentation of discount:
 * bonds payable - discount on B/P = bonds payable (net) 
* balance sheet presentation of premuim
 * bonds payable + premium on B/P = bonds payable (net)
* callable bonds (gain or loss on early retirement)
 * cash paid > carrying value -> loss on retriement
 * cash paid < carrying value -> gain on retirement
* properties of bonds (must repay bonds, must pay interst, interest is deductible, no dilution of ownership)
* properties of capital stock (no repayment of stock, need not pay dividends, dividends are not deductible, dilutes ownership)
