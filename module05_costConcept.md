## Cost Concepts
* Managerial Accounting - Determining & Using Costs (reasons for determining costs, differet costs for different purposes)
  Cost Objects:Products, Services, Departments, Programs, Projects, Activities
* Direct vs. indirect costs 
  * Direct - Traceable to cost object 
  * Indirect - Not traceable to cost object
* Manufacturing Costs vs. Non-manufacturing Costs
  * Manufacturing Costs: Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Manufacturing Overhead
  * Non-manufacturing Costs: Marketing, Administrative
* Product costs vs. Period costs
  * Product (Inventoriable) Costs -> Mfg. costs
  * Period (Non-inventoriable) Costs -> Non-mfg. costs
    * Not all costs have been incurred yet
    * Far removed from products

## Costs of goods manufactured
* Balance Sheet for Mfg. Company vs. Income Statement for Mfg. Company
  * Balance Sheet for Mfg. Company
    3 inventories: Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Work in Process
  * Income Statement for Mfg. Company 
    * Merchandising: Cost of Goods Sold = BI + Purchases – EI
    * Manufacturing: Cost of Goods Sold = BI + CGM – EI 
* Schedule of Cost of Goods Manufactured:
  Direct Materials Used [= B. DM + DM Purchases – E. DM]
  + Direct Labor 
  + Mfg. Overhead
  Mfg. Costs Incurred
  + B. WIP
  - E. WIP
  Cost of Goods Manufactured

## Overhead allocation 
* Allocation bases (cost drivers): Usually direct labor
* OH Rate: Total OH Cost / Total Activity
* Allocated OH = OH Rate x Actual Activity
* Short vs. Long Time Periods
  * Predetermined OH Rate: Est. OH Cost / Est. Activity
  * Applied OH = Predetermined OH Rate x Actual Activity
  * Applied OH > Actual OH -> Overapplied OH
  * Applied OH < Actual OH -> Underapplied OH
* Plant-Wide Rate vs. Departmental Rates
* Denominators:Ideal Capacity, Practical Capacity, Expected Volume, Normal Volume
* Using Expected Volume when demand is falling:
  Expected Volume falls => P. OH Rate rises => Applied OH rises => Product cost rises => Selling price rises => Demand falls further
