## Standard Costs
* Two cost components: (1) Price (2) Quantity
* Actual Cost = Actual Price x Actual Quantity
  * Standard – a target
  * Standard Price = Budgeted Price
  * Standard Quantity ≠ Budgeted Quantity
  * Standard Quantity: the amount of input that should have been used to produce the actual output
* Standard Cost = Standard Price x Standard Quantity
  Setting Standards:
  * Ideal (Strict) Standards
  * Easily Attainable Standards
  * Normal Operating Standards
* For Standard Prices, consider: Shipping charges, Discounts
* For Standard Quantities, consider: Breakage, Spillage, Theft

## Variance Analysis
* Actual Cost				                  Inputs at Standard				              Standard Cost
  AQ x AP---------------------------------AQ x SP--------------------------------SQ x SP
* DM Variances:
  * Materials Price Variance (MPV) = AQ (AP – SP)
  * Materials Quantity Variance (MQV) = SP (AQ – SQ)
  * Variances > 0 -> U
  * Variances < 0 -> F
* MQV ->	Use quantity used [MQV = SP (AQ – SQ)]
* MPV ->	Either quantity used or purchased, For cost control, compute variances as soon as possible. Quantity purchased is recommended.

* Actual Cost				                  Inputs at Standard				                Standard Cost
  AH x AR---------------------------------AH x SR--------------------------------SH x SR
* DL Variances:
  * Labor Rate Variance (LRV) = AH (AR – SR)
  * Labor Efficiency Variance LEV) = SR (AH – SH)
* Causes of MPV [AQ (AP – SP)]
  * Change of vendors
  * Different mode of transportation
  * Not taking anticipated purchase discounts
  * Different quality of materials
  * Unanticipated inflation
