## Introduction to corporate finance
### Objectives
In these finance modules we want you to……
* Understand how to evaluate long-term investment projects in terms of their ability to create shareholder value.
* Understand what it means to create shareholder value.
* Understand the key “value drivers” of shareholder value.
* Learn the concept of the cost of capital as the minimum rate of return that the corporation must earn on its invested capital to breakeven in economic terms.
* Understand how risk is measured and how it affects the cost of capital.

### Creating shareholder value
* shareholders are the owners of the corporation
* the primary financial goal of any public corporation is to create economic value for its shareholders

### Capital budgeting 
The process of determining exactly which assets to invest in and how much to invest is called capital budgeting decision or capital expenditure decision or capital investment decision.

### evaluating long-term investment projects
* time value of money

### Future value
* The general formula for finding the future value, FVt, of an investment of PV dollars today is:
  * FVt = PV x (1+r)^t

### Present value
* A more common method for evaluating your investment alternatives is to calculate present values.
  * The present value is the amount of money you would need to invest today in order to duplicate some future dollar amount.

## decision rules for capital investment
### net present value (NPV)
* Most investments made by corporations are long-term in nature and generate cash flows for many years in the future. The most common method for evaluating these long-term investments as Net Present Value (NPV):

* The NPV measures the value created for shareholders by the investment project.
  * If NPV > 0, then the project increases shareholder value and should be accepted.
  * If NPV < 0, the the project destroys shareholder value and should be rejected.
* Because of the need to make large investments up front, the early cash flows are typically negative for most investment projects.

### independent vs. mutually exclusive project
* Independent :  Acceptance or rejection is independent of the acceptance or rejection of other projects.
* Mutually Exclusive:  Can accept “A” or you can accept “B” or you can reject both of them, but cannot accept both of them.

### payback period
* A project’s payback period is the number of periods (usually measured in years) required for the sum of the project’s expected cash flows to equal its initial cash outlay.  In other words, the payback period is the time it takes for a firm to recover its initial investment.

### internet rate of return 
* A project’s internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of the project equal to zero:

Accept the project if IRR is greater than the cost of capital

### profitability index(PI)
* The present value of an investment’s future cash flows divided by its initial cost.  Also called benefit/cost ratio.
r = 5%
  * PI for “A”	=   (100 + 19.05)  /  (100)	=   1.19
  * PI for “B”	=   (200+72.32)  /  (200)	=   1.36
  * PI for “C”	=   (300+131.92)  /  (300)	=   1.44
